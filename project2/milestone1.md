#Milestone 1: 

For this project, I propose to do a very very simple single activity android app that will tell the user the chance of snow for each day in December. The app will allow the user to pick a date in December, and also a location (for the sake of simplicity, I will allow the user to pick major cities in Colorado). 

Upon clicking the "Let it snow!" button (or something equally cheesy) the app will calculate the odds of snowfall and the odds of snow being on the ground for that date in December for that location. 

This means that the app is very simple, but is also slightly useful and kinda cute, since I always love the idea of having snowfall for the holidays!

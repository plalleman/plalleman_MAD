#Milestone 2 

For this milestone, I have a basic layout in the app of what I think I want to do. While the image will change and functionality will be added, essentially it is a good window of what it will look like. 

Functionality that will be added will include getting the date for "today is" from the system, and also using the open weather api to get information about snowfall for that day when the button is pressed.

Milestone 4 

Reflection: 

This app and project went much more smoothly than the last project. Originally, I was going to do a "Will it snow?" app, but if I was going to do that I might as well make a weather app (since I get so much data from the API anyway). Part of what influenced the changes in this project was the use of the API - data more than a day or two in advance not only costs money but also complicates the API Call quite a bit and made the project intensely more complicated. At the end of the day, I both added complexity and simplified it. 

The challenging part of this project was getting the API Working, I have worked with the weather API before but not to the extent that I needed for this project. In addition, one of the first things I found was that best practice for the API implementation was to run it with Async in "do in background" so that the app wouldn't hang if the API was slow. 

One of the things that I wish I had more time to include was to use location data to send a latitude and longitude to the API and get weather that isn't hard-coded to be for Boulder. This presented some early challenges so I decided that itwas outside of the scope of this simple project, but it is something that I would love to implement in the future.

#Milestone 4: Reflection 

This project ended up going pretty well, once I re-did the design to fit more closely with the original requirements. While I was really excited with my initial idea, the multi-view app design quickly got far too complicated and frustrating to complete on time. I ended up simplifying it quite radically to simply calculate the cost of commuting. I still find this fairly useful, because it's hard to see what the actual cost is for me driving everyday (still cheaper than rent in Boulder!). 

Next time, I would design the app initially to be more simple, or alternatively I would love to continue studying and gain some experience with multi-view applications before trying a project of the original intended scale again.

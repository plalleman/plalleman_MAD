Project 1 Milestone 1 

Description of app, inspiration and goal:

For this project, I propose to create an application that tracks my driving and car/gas calculations in a very simple, easy to use way.  I want to be able to enter all of the data about what car I'm driving only once (or select from a list of my cars) and then make the app do all further calculations based on that data.

Intended audience: 
The intended audience of this application is commuters - people who drive to work or school everyday and need more insight into their gas use, cost of fuel and owning a car 

Research and precedents: 

There is much precedent for this type of application, and there are many of them available currently in the app store. However, I think many, if not all of these, have some large faults. One, they all look terrible. And two, they are highly geared (haha) towards "petrolheads", i.e. people who are car superfans. I want an app that is easy to use for everyday people and does a few simple, easy tasks. 

Intended source of content:

Project 1 Milestone 1 

Description of app, inspiration and goal:

For this project, I propose to create an application that tracks my driving and car/gas calculations in a very simple, easy to use way.  I want to be able to enter all of the data about what car I'm driving only once (or select from a list of my cars) and then make the app do all further calculations based on that data. Features would center around keeping track of driving distance, gas consumption, and vehicle maitanence. 

Intended audience:

The intended audience of this application is commuters - people who drive to work or school everyday and need more insight into their gas use, or need help with budgeting the cost of fuel and owning a car. The app would be aimed primarily at young people and particularly those who use a car regularly, but do not necessarily need a ton of fancy features to take good care of their vehicles. 

Precedents: 

There is much precedent for this type of application, and there are many of them available currently in the app store. However, I think many, if not all of these, have some large faults. One, most of them do not look very nice. And two, they are highly geared (haha) towards "petrolheads", i.e. people who are car superfans, and want the absolute best possible performance out of their car. I want an app that is easy to use for everyday people, and does a few simple, easy tasks surrounding gas, oil changes/tire rotations, and general maitanence that everyone does. 

Intended source of content: 

Ideally, most of the information would be added by the consumer on startup, including make and model, gas tank capacity, normal fuel up points, etc.
